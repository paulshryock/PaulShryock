Black lives matter.

### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I live and work remotely in New Jersey, with my wife, Jess. I'm currently a **WordPress Engineer** at the [NBA][nba], where I develop digital products for the league, as well as for the [WNBA](wnba), [G League](g-league), and [NBA 2K League](nba-2k-league). I'm also a part-time **Web Developer** at [Palantir][palantir], maintaining their public-facing marketing site.

Proud to be listed as an open source contributor to [eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/graphs/contributors) and [postcss](https://github.com/postcss/postcss/graphs/contributors).

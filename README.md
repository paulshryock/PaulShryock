# Ethical Software Engineer

I'm a WordPress Engineer at the [NBA](https://www.nba.com/), where I build next-level CMS authoring experiences. I always aim to make the web more accessible, inclusive, and ethical.

I use a lot of open source code in my work, and I contribute back to those projects when I can.

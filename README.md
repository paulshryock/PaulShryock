# Senior Software Engineer

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at the [NBA](https://www.nba.com/), where I build next-level CMS authoring experiences. I aim to make software more accessible, inclusive, secure, and performance.

I use a lot of open source code in my work, and I contribute back to those projects when I can.
